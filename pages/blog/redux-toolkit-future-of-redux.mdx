This blog is written considering that you already know about previous version of redux and you would like to explore the new redux-toolkit.

Redux is a very popular library for state management. But it become very tiresome to create and initialize the store, create the reducers and the corresponding action while maintaining them in separate folders. All these problems are fixed in the latest version of Redux called Redux Toolkit where all the reducers, actions and initial state are present in a single slice which makes it easy to manage.

To get started we need to install the redux packages.

<PreWrapper code={code1} language="jsx" />

After the packages are installed, we need to initialize the store, this will be a one-time process and we do not have to touch it again unless we want to add new reducers. Import the `configureStore` API from Redux Toolkit. Inside the folder `src/redux/store.js` create the store and keep it empty for now. We will add the reducers after creating slice.

<PreWrapper code={code2} language="jsx" />

Once the store is created, we need to provide it to react and all the child components. To do so we will go to `src/index.js` and write the below code.

<PreWrapper code={code3} language="jsx" />

Add a new file named `src/counter/counterSlice.js`. In that file, import the createSlice API from Redux Toolkit.

Creating a slice requires a string name to identify the slice, an initial state value, and one or more reducer functions to define how the state can be updated. Once a slice is created, we can export the generated Redux action creators and the reducer function for the whole slice.

Redux requires that we write all state updates immutably, by making copies of data and updating the copies. However, Redux Toolkit's createSlice and createReducer APIs use Immer inside to allow us to write "mutating" update logic that becomes correct immutable updates.

<PreWrapper language="jsx" code={code4} />

Next, we need to import the reducer function from the counter slice and add it to our store. By defining a field inside the reducers parameter, we tell the store to use this slice reducer function to handle all updates to that state.

<PreWrapper language="jsx" code={code5} />

Now we can use the React-Redux hooks to let React components interact with the Redux store. We can read data from the store with `useSelector`, and `dispatch` actions using `useDispatch`. Below is the given example.

<PreWrapper code={code6} language="jsx" />
